**README for Linked List Implementation in C**

**Overview**
This README provides a detailed explanation of a C program that demonstrates how to create and manipulate a linked list using dynamic memory allocation. The program includes functions for node creation, appending elements, printing the list, and finding nodes by value. It serves as a foundational example for beginners to understand linked list operations and memory management in C.

**1. Structure Definition (`list_t`)**
The linked list is implemented using a structure named `list_t`. Each node in the list contains:
- **`key`**: An integer representing the value stored in the node.
- **`next`**: A pointer to the next node in the linked list.

This structure allows for dynamic data storage, where each node can point to the next, forming a chain of elements.

**2. Functions**

- **`create_node(int value)`**
  - **Purpose**: Allocates memory for a new node, initializes it with a given value, and returns a pointer to the new node.
  - **Error Handling**: If memory allocation fails, the function prints an error message and terminates the program to prevent undefined behavior.
  - **Usage**: Used to create individual nodes that can be linked to form the list.

- **`append_node(list_t **head, int value)`**
  - **Purpose**: Adds a new node with the given value at the end of the linked list.
  - **Usage**: Takes a double pointer to the head of the list, ensuring that the list remains updated when new nodes are appended.

- **`print_list(list_t *head)`**
  - **Purpose**: Traverses the linked list and prints the value of each node in sequence.
  - **Output Format**: Prints the values in the form `value1 -> value2 -> ... -> NULL`.
  - **Usage**: Useful for visualizing the linked list structure and its elements.

- **`find_node(list_t *head, int value)`**
  - **Purpose**: Searches for a node with a specific value in the linked list.
  - **Return Value**: Returns a pointer to the node if found, otherwise returns `NULL`.
  - **Usage**: Helps in locating nodes for operations like deletion or updating.

**3. Memory Management**
Dynamic memory allocation is used throughout the program to ensure flexibility in creating nodes. The `malloc` function is used to allocate memory for each new node, and it is essential to manage this memory properly to avoid leaks.
- **`malloc`**: Allocates memory for each new node.
- **`free`**: Although not included in every function, nodes must be freed when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. This can be implemented in future extensions of the program.

**4. Main Function Overview**
The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the above functions:
- **Creates** an empty linked list (`head` is initially `NULL`).
- **Appends** nodes with values 10, 20, 30, and 40.
- **Prints** the linked list to show the elements.
- **Finds** a node with a specific value (`20` in this example) and prints whether it was found.

**5. How to Compile and Run**
To compile and run the program:

1. Save the code to a file (e.g., `linked_list.c`).
2. Use the following command to compile:
   ```bash
   gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./linked_list
   ```
   The program will output:
   ```
   Linked list: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> NULL
   Node with value 20 found.
   ```

**6. Summary**
This linked list implementation in C provides a basic introduction to:
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `malloc` to allocate memory for new elements.
- **Linked List Operations**: Creating, appending, and searching nodes.
- **Error Handling**: Managing errors during memory allocation to ensure program stability.

This foundational example can be expanded to include additional operations such as deletion, reversing the list, or sorting elements.
