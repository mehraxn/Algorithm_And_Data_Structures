# Dynamic String Allocation with Structures in C

## Overview
This C program demonstrates how to dynamically allocate memory for a series of strings stored within a structure. Each string is managed using a dynamically allocated pointer to ensure flexibility in size and memory management. The program allows the user to specify a number of strings and input them, which are then stored and printed before freeing the memory to prevent memory leaks.

## Code Features

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** The program uses `malloc()` to dynamically allocate memory for both an array of structures and for individual strings.
- **Structures in C:** A structure (`e_s`) is defined with a `char *` pointer to hold each string.
- **User Interaction:** The user is prompted to specify how many strings they want to store, and the content of each string.
- **Memory Safety:** The program includes checks for successful memory allocation and deallocates all allocated memory before exiting.

## Code Explanation

### Header Files

- `#include <stdio.h>`: Includes the standard I/O functions used for printing and reading user input.
- `#include <stdlib.h>`: Provides functions for dynamic memory management (`malloc()` and `free()`).
- `#include <string.h>`: Provides string manipulation functions (`strlen()` and `strcpy()`).

### Macros and Definitions

- `#define N 100`: Defines a constant `N` which is the maximum buffer size for reading strings from the user.

### Structure Definition

- `typedef struct e_s { char *str; } e_t;`:
  - Defines a structure `e_t` with a `char *` named `str`. This pointer will be used to store dynamically allocated strings.

### Main Function

1. **Input Number of Elements:** The program first prompts the user to input the number of strings (`n`) they want to store.

    ```c
    printf("Enter the number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    ```

2. **Allocate Memory for Structures:**
   - Allocates memory for `n` elements of type `e_t` using `malloc()`. Each element represents a structure that will hold a string.
   - If memory allocation fails, an error message is printed, and the program exits with a status code of `1`.

    ```c
    e_t *v = (e_t *)malloc(n * sizeof(e_t));
    if (v == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed for the structure array!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    ```

3. **Input Strings and Allocate Memory for Each:**
   - A loop is used to read a string from the user for each element of `v`. The strings are read into a temporary buffer `s` of size `N`.
   - After reading the string, memory is allocated for each string based on its length.
   - The string is then copied from the buffer into the dynamically allocated memory.

    ```c
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Enter string %d: ", i + 1);
        scanf("%s", s);
        v[i].str = (char *)malloc((strlen(s) + 1) * sizeof(char));
        if (v[i].str == NULL) {
            printf("Memory allocation failed for string %d!\n", i + 1);
            return 1;
        }
        strcpy(v[i].str, s);
    }
    ```

4. **Print Stored Strings:**
   - After all strings have been stored, the program prints each one to verify the correctness.

    ```c
    printf("\nStored strings:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", v[i].str);
    }
    ```

5. **Free Allocated Memory:**
   - The program loops through each element of `v` to free the memory allocated for each string.
   - Finally, the memory for the array of structures itself is deallocated.

    ```c
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        free(v[i].str);
    }
    free(v);
    ```

### Memory Management

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** The program uses `malloc()` to allocate memory at runtime, which allows the user to specify how many strings to enter and how large each string can be.
- **Memory Deallocation:** The use of `free()` is critical to prevent memory leaks by ensuring that both the strings and the array of structures are deallocated properly.

### Limitations and Improvements

- **Buffer Overflow Risk:** The use of `scanf("%s", s)` without a length specifier can lead to buffer overflow if the user inputs a string longer than `N`. This can be improved by using `fgets()` or by specifying a maximum length in `scanf()`, such as `scanf("%99s", s)`.
- **Error Handling:** If memory allocation fails at any point, the program currently exits immediately. More sophisticated error recovery could involve freeing previously allocated memory and allowing the user to reattempt the allocation.
- **Input Restrictions:** The program does not handle whitespace in input strings, since `scanf("%s", s)` reads only until the first whitespace. Using `fgets()` instead would allow for better handling of multi-word strings.

## Compilation and Execution

1. **Compile the Program:**
   
   ```sh
   gcc -o dynamic_strings dynamic_strings.c
   ```

2. **Run the Executable:**
   
   ```sh
   ./dynamic_strings
   ```

3. **Example Output:**
   
   ```
   Enter the number of elements: 3
   Enter string 1: Hello
   Enter string 2: World
   Enter string 3: Dynamic

   Stored strings:
   Hello
   World
   Dynamic
   ```

## Conclusion
This program provides a simple demonstration of dynamic memory management in C. It highlights how to use `malloc()` and `free()` effectively to allocate and deallocate memory for structures containing strings. This is a valuable skill for handling data that requires flexibility in size and is crucial for writing memory-efficient C programs.
