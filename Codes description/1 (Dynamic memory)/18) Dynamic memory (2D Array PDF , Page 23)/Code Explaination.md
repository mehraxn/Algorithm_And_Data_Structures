# README: malloc2d Function Example

## Overview
This project demonstrates the allocation and usage of a 2D array of characters in C. The main function of interest is `malloc2d()`, which is used to dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array of characters. The code also includes a `main()` function to demonstrate how the allocated memory can be utilized, manipulated, and subsequently freed. This README provides detailed usage instructions, descriptions of the functions, and memory management practices implemented in the code.

### Files Included
- `malloc2d_function.c`: Contains the implementation of the `malloc2d()` function along with a `main()` function for demonstration purposes.

## Functions

### 1. malloc2d(char ***m, int r, int c)
The `malloc2d()` function is used to allocate memory for a 2D array of characters with the specified number of rows and columns.

- **Parameters**:
  - `char ***m`: A triple pointer used to return the address of the allocated memory for the 2D array.
  - `int r`: Number of rows to allocate.
  - `int c`: Number of columns to allocate.

- **Return Value**: This function does not return a value but modifies the provided triple pointer (`*m`) to point to the allocated 2D array.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - First, it allocates memory for an array of pointers, each representing a row of the 2D array.
  - It then allocates memory for each row, enough to hold `c` characters.
  - Proper error handling is implemented to check if memory allocation succeeds. If any allocation fails, the function frees any previously allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
  - Finally, the allocated 2D array is assigned to the provided triple pointer (`*m`).

### 2. main()
The `main()` function demonstrates how to use the `malloc2d()` function to create and work with a 2D array.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - Defines the number of rows (`rows`) and columns (`cols`) to be allocated.
  - Calls `malloc2d()` to allocate a 2D array with the specified dimensions.
  - Assigns character values (`A`, `B`, `C`, etc.) to the elements of the 2D array.
  - Prints the 2D array to the console.
  - Frees all allocated memory to ensure proper memory management.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Compilation**:
   - Use the following command to compile the code:
     ```sh
     gcc -o malloc2d_function malloc2d_function.c
     ```
   - This will produce an executable named `malloc2d_function`.

2. **Running the Program**:
   - Run the program using:
     ```sh
     ./malloc2d_function
     ```
   - The program will allocate a 2D array of characters with 3 rows and 4 columns, fill it with character values (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`), and display the resulting array.

## Example Output
When you run the program, it will produce the following output:
```
The 2D character array:
A B C D
A B C D
A B C D
```

## Memory Management
- The program uses `malloc()` to dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array of characters.
- **Proper Memory Management**: The program demonstrates the importance of freeing dynamically allocated memory after use to prevent memory leaks.
- In case of memory allocation failure, the program includes mechanisms to clean up any partially allocated memory before exiting, ensuring robust memory management.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Using `malloc()` to allocate memory for both rows and columns of a 2D array.
- **Pointer Usage**: Utilizing a triple pointer (`char ***`) to allocate and return the address of the allocated memory for a 2D array.
- **Error Handling**: Proper checks are performed to ensure that memory allocation is successful. If not, the program exits gracefully after cleaning up.
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Using pointers to access and manipulate elements of the dynamically allocated 2D array.

## Notes
- The number of rows and columns (`rows = 3`, `cols = 4`) used in the example can be modified to test different sizes of arrays.
- This code is intended for educational purposes, demonstrating the basics of dynamic memory allocation and proper memory management in C.

## Dependencies
- **Standard Libraries**: The code uses the following standard libraries:
  - `<stdio.h>`: For input/output operations.
  - `<stdlib.h>`: For dynamic memory management functions such as `malloc()` and `free()`.
