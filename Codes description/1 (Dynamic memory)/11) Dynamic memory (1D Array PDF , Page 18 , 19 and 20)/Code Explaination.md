/*
Functions and Operations Summary:

1. **`fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode)`**: Opens the specified file in the given mode. Here, `fopen` is used to open "data.txt" in read mode (`"r"`). If the file cannot be opened, an error message is printed, and the function returns.

2. **`fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...)`**: Reads formatted input from the specified file stream. In this code, `fscanf` is used to read the number of elements and the elements themselves from the file. If reading fails at any point, an error message is printed.

3. **`malloc(size_t size)`**: Allocates a block of memory of the specified size. The function uses `malloc` to allocate memory for an array of integers based on the value of `*n`. If allocation fails, an error message is printed, and the function returns.

4. **`free(void *ptr)`**: Frees the dynamically allocated memory pointed to by `ptr`. If any error occurs during reading, the allocated memory is freed to avoid memory leaks.

5. **`fclose(FILE *stream)`**: Closes the specified file to release resources. After reading all data from the file, `fclose` is called to properly close the file.

The `read_and_store` function reads integers from a file named "data.txt" and stores them in a dynamically allocated array. It demonstrates basic file handling, memory allocation, and error checking in C. The function parameters include a double pointer `int **ptr` to allow the function to modify the pointer passed to it, and an integer pointer `int *n` to store the number of elements read from the file.
