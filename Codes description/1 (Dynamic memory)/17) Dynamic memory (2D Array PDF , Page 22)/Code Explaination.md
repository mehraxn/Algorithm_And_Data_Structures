# README: malloc2d Example Function

## Overview
This project demonstrates the allocation and usage of a 2D array of characters in C. It includes a simple function, `malloc2d()`, that dynamically allocates a 2D array of characters with a specified number of rows and columns. This README provides details on the usage, functionality, and proper memory management practices demonstrated in the code.

### Files Included
- `malloc2d_example.c`: Contains the implementation of the `malloc2d()` function, as well as a main function to demonstrate its use.

## Functions

### 1. malloc2d(int r, int c)
The `malloc2d()` function is responsible for allocating memory for a 2D array of characters based on the given number of rows and columns.
- **Parameters**:
  - `int r`: Number of rows to allocate.
  - `int c`: Number of columns to allocate.
- **Return Value**: Returns a pointer to the allocated 2D array (`char **`).
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Allocates memory for `r` pointers, each representing a row.
  - Allocates memory for each row, ensuring that each row can store `c` characters.
  - Handles memory allocation errors, and if any allocation fails, it frees previously allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
  - If allocation is successful, returns a pointer to the 2D array.

### 2. main()
The `main()` function demonstrates the usage of the `malloc2d()` function.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Defines the number of rows (`rows`) and columns (`cols`) to be allocated.
  - Uses `malloc2d()` to allocate the 2D array.
  - Assigns character values (`A`, `B`, `C`, etc.) to the elements of the 2D array.
  - Prints the 2D array to the console.
  - Frees all allocated memory to ensure no memory leaks.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Compilation**:
   - Use the following command to compile the code:
     ```sh
     gcc -o malloc2d_example malloc2d_example.c
     ```
   - This will produce an executable named `malloc2d_example`.

2. **Running the Program**:
   - Run the program using:
     ```sh
     ./malloc2d_example
     ```
   - The program will allocate a 2D array of characters with 3 rows and 4 columns, fill it with character values (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`), and display the resulting array.

## Example Output
When you run the program, it will produce the following output:
```
The 2D character array:
A B C D
A B C D
A B C D
```

## Memory Management
- The program allocates memory dynamically for a 2D array of characters.
- Proper memory management practices are demonstrated by freeing all allocated memory after use.
- In case of allocation failure, the program includes mechanisms to clean up any previously allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The use of `malloc()` to allocate memory for both rows and columns of a 2D array.
- **Error Handling**: Proper checks are performed to ensure that memory allocation is successful. If not, the program exits gracefully after cleaning up.
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: The use of pointers to access and manipulate elements of the dynamically allocated 2D array.

## Notes
- The number of rows and columns in the example (`rows = 3`, `cols = 4`) can be easily modified to test different sizes of arrays.
- The code is intended for educational purposes, focusing on dynamic memory allocation and its proper management in C.

## Dependencies
- Standard libraries used: `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>` for input/output and dynamic memory management.
