#Binary Search Program

## Overview
This program demonstrates the use of the binary search algorithm to efficiently find an element in a sorted array. It includes two main parts:
1. The `bin_search` function: A recursive function that performs the binary search.
2. The `main` function: A function that initializes an array, accepts user input, and calls the binary search function to display the result.

## Function Descriptions

### 1. `bin_search` Function
The `bin_search` function implements the binary search algorithm to locate the position of a target element (`k`) in a sorted array (`v[]`). It takes four parameters:
- `v[]`: The sorted array of integers.
- `l`: The left index of the current search range.
- `r`: The right index of the current search range.
- `k`: The target element to search for.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Base Case**: If the left index (`l`) exceeds the right index (`r`), it indicates that the element is not present in the array, and the function returns `-1`.
2. **Calculate Midpoint**: The function calculates the midpoint (`c = (l + r) / 2`) of the current search range.
3. **Recursive Search**:
   - If the target element (`k`) is less than the value at the midpoint (`v[c]`), the function searches in the left half by recursively calling itself with updated indices (`l` to `c - 1`).
   - If the target element (`k`) is greater than the value at the midpoint, the function searches in the right half by recursively calling itself with updated indices (`c + 1` to `r`).
4. **Element Found**: If the value at the midpoint matches the target (`k`), the function returns the index (`c`).

The binary search algorithm is efficient because it reduces the search range by half at each step, resulting in a time complexity of **O(log n)**.

### 2. `main` Function
The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program and demonstrates the usage of the `bin_search` function:
- **Array Definition**: It defines a sorted array of integers (`v[]`) for testing purposes.
- **User Input**: It prompts the user to enter the value to be searched (`k`).
- **Binary Search Execution**: It calls the `bin_search` function with the array, starting index (`0`), ending index (`n - 1`), and the target value (`k`).
- **Output**: It prints the result to indicate whether the element was found and, if so, at which index.

## How to Compile and Run the Program
To compile and run the program, use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
gcc binary_search_function.c -o binary_search_function
./binary_search_function
```

### Expected Output
The program will prompt the user to enter a value to search for, and it will display whether the value was found in the array and its index:

```
Input the value to search: 5
Element 5 found at index 2
```

If the value is not present in the array, it will output:

```
Input the value to search: 6
Element 6 not found in the array
```

## Summary
The binary search program is a simple yet powerful demonstration of how to efficiently search for an element in a sorted array. The **`bin_search`** function uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to locate the target value by repeatedly halving the search range until the value is found or determined to be absent.

The key advantage of the binary search algorithm is its efficiency, with a time complexity of **O(log n)**, which makes it suitable for large sorted datasets. This implementation uses recursion to simplify the logic, making the code more readable and demonstrating a fundamental algorithmic concept.

The **`main`** function integrates user interaction, allowing users to test the binary search function with their own input values. The program demonstrates the practical application of the binary search algorithm and highlights its efficiency in searching sorted arrays.
