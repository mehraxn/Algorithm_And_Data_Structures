Key Concepts Explained in Comments:

// Primâ€™s Algorithm:
// - Builds an MST by starting with one vertex and repeatedly adding the smallest edge
//   that connects a new vertex to the existing tree.

// Fringe Array:
// - Tracks which vertex is connected to each other in the growing MST.
// - Used to print the edges in the MST.

// Distance (dist):
// - Represents the minimum weight of an edge connecting a vertex to the MST.

// Predecessor (pred):
// - Keeps track of which vertex connects to another in the MST.

// Adjacency List Traversal:
// - The `head` pointer of each vertex points to a linked list of edges, used to explore neighboring vertices.

// Edge Selection:
// - Only unconnected vertices (with `pred == -1`) are considered for adding to the MST.
