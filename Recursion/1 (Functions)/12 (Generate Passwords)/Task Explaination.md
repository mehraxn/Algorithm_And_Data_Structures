### Task: Generate Palindrome Passwords

#### **Problem Description:**
You are tasked to write a program that generates all valid palindrome passwords consisting of exactly **7 characters** based on the following constraints:

1. The password must be a palindrome string, which means it reads the same forward and backward.
2. The characters are structured as follows:
   - The **first** and **seventh** characters must be the same lowercase letter (a-z).
   - The **second** and **sixth** characters must be the same uppercase letter (A-Z).
   - The **third** and **fifth** characters must be the same digit (0-9).
   - The **fourth** character must be either a `-` or a `+` symbol.

#### **Example of Valid Passwords:**
- `aA1-1Aa`
- `cZ9+9Zc`
- `fL0+0Lf`

#### **Invalid Password Example:**
- `aA1+1Ab` (seventh character 'b' does not match first character 'a').

#### **Program Output:**
- Print each valid palindrome password on a new line.
- Display the total number of generated passwords at the end.

#### **Expected Output Example:**
```
aA0-0Aa
aA0+0Aa
aA1-1Aa
...
The total number of valid passwords is: 13520
```
