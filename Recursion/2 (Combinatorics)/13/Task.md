# Generating 4-Digit Numbers from Groups of Numbers

## Problem Statement
You are given four groups of numbers:

- **Group 1:** \( 6 \) and \( 1 \)
- **Group 2:** \( 4 \) and \( 8 \)
- **Group 3:** \( 7 \) and \( 3 \)
- **Group 4:** \( 9 \) and \( 0 \)

The task is to:

1. Form all possible 4-digit numbers by picking exactly **one number** from each group.
2. Calculate the **total number** of 4-digit numbers that can be created.
3. Provide examples of some of these numbers.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Understand the Groups
Each group provides two possible numbers to choose from. Since there are four groups, and you must pick one number from each group, this is a combinatorial problem involving combinations of choices.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Combinations
To find the total number of 4-digit numbers that can be formed:
- Multiply the number of choices in each group.
- For this problem:

\[
\text{Total Combinations} = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16
\]

### Step 3: List Examples
To generate examples, select one number from each group systematically. For instance:

- Choose \( 6 \) from Group 1, \( 4 \) from Group 2, \( 7 \) from Group 3, and \( 9 \) from Group 4: The number is **6479**.
- Choose \( 1 \) from Group 1, \( 8 \) from Group 2, \( 3 \) from Group 3, and \( 0 \) from Group 4: The number is **1830**.

### General Formula
If there are \( n_1, n_2, n_3, \dots, n_k \) numbers in each of \( k \) groups, the total number of combinations is:

\[
\text{Total Combinations} = n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3 \times \dots \times n_k
\]

For this problem, each group has 2 numbers, so the total is \( 2^4 = 16 \).

## Task
- Generate all 16 numbers systematically.
- Verify the count by listing all combinations explicitly.

## Example Output
Some examples of the 4-digit numbers are:
- **6479**
- **1830**
- **6439**
- **1730**

Ensure all 16 numbers are unique and valid.
