# Permutations and Combinatorics Project for Exam

## Project Description:
This project is designed to test your understanding of permutations and combinatorics. You will solve a series of tasks based on arranging and selecting letters. Each task will involve different aspects of combinatorial mathematics, focusing on ordered and unordered selections. This project is suitable for students preparing for computer science exams or anyone looking to strengthen their problem-solving skills in discrete mathematics.

## Tasks:

### Task 1: Permutation of 5 Letters
Given the set of letters: **A, B, C, D, E**, determine how many different ways you can arrange all 5 letters in a line.
- **Hint:** Use the formula for permutations of n distinct items:  
  **n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1**.

### Task 2: Permutations of 3 Chosen Letters
From the set {A, B, C, D, E}, you are only allowed to choose 3 out of the 5 letters. Determine how many different 3-letter arrangements (permutations) can be made.
- **Hint:** Use the formula for permutations of r items chosen from n items:  
  **P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!**.

### Task 3: Combinations of 3 Letters
From the same set {A, B, C, D, E}, determine how many distinct groups of 3 letters can be formed if the order does not matter.
- **Hint:** Use the formula for combinations:  
  **C(n, r) = n! / [r! × (n-r)!]**.

### Task 4: Permutations with a Condition
Determine how many ways you can arrange the letters {A, B, C, D, E} if the letter "A" must always be at the beginning of the arrangement.
- **Hint:** Fix "A" in the first position, then find permutations of the remaining 4 letters.

### Task 5: Permutations with Repeated Letters
Consider a set of letters with repetitions: {A, A, A, B, B}. Determine how many unique ways you can arrange these letters.
- **Hint:** Use the formula for permutations with repeated items:  
  **n! / (p1! × p2! × ... × pk!)**, where p1, p2, ..., pk are the factorials of the frequencies of the repeated items.

## Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your answers in a well-organized document.
- Clearly show all calculations and formulas used.
- Provide explanations or justifications for each answer.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Your project will be evaluated based on the following:
- **Accuracy:** Correctness of answers and calculations.
- **Clarity:** Clear presentation of steps and reasoning.
- **Completeness:** Answering all tasks thoroughly.
- **Neatness:** Well-organized and readable submission.

Good luck, and enjoy solving these combinatorial challenges!
