# Complete Guide to Binary Tree Level Order Bottom Traversal in C

This article provides a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of the `levelOrderBottom` function implementation for binary trees in C. This function performs a bottom-up level order traversal, meaning it visits nodes level by level from bottom to top.

## Problem Definition

The problem asks us to implement the following function:

```c
int** levelOrderBottom(struct TreeNode* root, int* returnSize, int** returnColumnSizes);
```

This function should:
1. Traverse a binary tree level by level
2. Return the node values in bottom-to-top level order
3. Return properly allocated arrays that the caller will free later

The binary tree is represented by nodes defined as:

```c
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    struct TreeNode *left;
    struct TreeNode *right;
};
```

## Function Parameters

- `root`: Pointer to the root node of the binary tree
- `returnSize`: Pointer to an integer where we'll store the number of levels in the tree
- `returnColumnSizes`: Pointer to an array where we'll store the number of nodes at each level

## Algorithm Overview

The solution uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) with these steps:
1. Traverse the tree level by level using a queue (classic BFS)
2. Store each level's nodes in separate arrays
3. Reverse the order of these arrays to get the bottom-up view

## Complete Solution with Line-by-Line Explanation

```c
int** levelOrderBottom(struct TreeNode* root, int* returnSize, int** returnColumnSizes) {
    // Handle empty tree case
    if (root == NULL) {
        *returnSize = 0;
        *returnColumnSizes = NULL;
        return NULL;
    }
```

First, we handle the edge case of an empty tree. If `root` is `NULL`, we set `returnSize` to 0, `returnColumnSizes` to `NULL`, and return `NULL`.

```c
    // We'll use a queue for BFS
    struct TreeNode** queue = (struct TreeNode**)malloc(10000 * sizeof(struct TreeNode*));
    int front = 0, rear = 0;
```

We allocate memory for a queue to perform BFS. We use a fixed-size array as a queue implementation with `front` and `rear` pointers to track the queue boundaries. The size 10000 is chosen to be large enough for most practical binary trees.

```c
    // We'll store the result temporarily before reversing
    int** result = (int**)malloc(2000 * sizeof(int*));
    int* colSizes = (int*)malloc(2000 * sizeof(int));
    int levelCount = 0;
```

We allocate memory for temporary storage of results:
- `result`: A 2D array to store node values at each level
- `colSizes`: An array to store the number of nodes at each level
- `levelCount`: A counter for the number of levels

```c
    // Start BFS with root
    queue[rear++] = root;
```

We enqueue the root node to start the BFS traversal. The `rear++` operation adds the node to the queue and then increments the rear pointer.

```c
    while (front < rear) {
        // Get the size of current level
        int levelSize = rear - front;
```

We start the BFS loop, which continues as long as there are nodes in the queue. At the beginning of each iteration, we calculate `levelSize`, which is the number of nodes at the current level.

```c
        // Allocate space for current level
        result[levelCount] = (int*)malloc(levelSize * sizeof(int));
        colSizes[levelCount] = levelSize;
```

We allocate memory for the current level's node values and record the level's size.

```c
        // Process all nodes at current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            struct TreeNode* node = queue[front++];
```

We process each node at the current level. The `front++` operation dequeues a node and increments the front pointer.

```c
            // Add the node value to result
            result[levelCount][i] = node->val;
```

We store the current node's value in our result array.

```c
            // Enqueue left child if exists
            if (node->left) {
                queue[rear++] = node->left;
            }
            
            // Enqueue right child if exists
            if (node->right) {
                queue[rear++] = node->right;
            }
        }
```

For each node, we enqueue its left and right children if they exist. This ensures we'll process the next level in the next iteration of the outer while loop.

```c
        levelCount++;
    }
```

After processing all nodes at the current level, we increment the level counter and continue with the next level.

```c
    // Free the queue as we no longer need it
    free(queue);
```

Once we've processed all levels, we free the queue memory since we no longer need it.

```c
    // Now we need to reverse the order of levels (bottom-up)
    int** bottomUpResult = (int**)malloc(levelCount * sizeof(int*));
    *returnColumnSizes = (int*)malloc(levelCount * sizeof(int));
```

We allocate memory for the final bottom-up result and the returnColumnSizes array.

```c
    for (int i = 0; i < levelCount; i++) {
        bottomUpResult[i] = result[levelCount - 1 - i];
        (*returnColumnSizes)[i] = colSizes[levelCount - 1 - i];
    }
```

We reverse the order of levels by copying pointers from the `result` array to the `bottomUpResult` array in reverse order. We do the same for the column sizes.

```c
    // Free the colSizes array as we've transferred its data
    free(colSizes);
    // Free the result array but not its contents as they're now referenced by bottomUpResult
    free(result);
```

We free the temporary arrays, but not the actual level data they point to, since those pointers have been transferred to our final result arrays.

```c
    *returnSize = levelCount;
    return bottomUpResult;
}
```

Finally, we set the `returnSize` to the number of levels and return the bottom-up result.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(n)
- We visit each node exactly once during the BFS traversal, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- The reversal operation takes O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree (number of levels).
- Since h â‰¤ n, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Space Complexity: O(n)
- Queue space: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (maximum number of nodes at any level).
- Result arrays: O(n) for storing all node values.
- In the worst case, w can be n/2 for a complete binary tree, so the overall space complexity is O(n).

## Key Insights and Techniques

1. **Queue-based BFS**: This is a classic application of BFS for level order traversal, where a queue helps maintain the correct processing order.

2. **Level-by-level Processing**: By calculating the current level size at the beginning of each iteration, we can process nodes level by level.

3. **Pointer Manipulation for Reversal**: Instead of copying the actual data, we simply rearrange pointers to achieve the reversal, which is more efficient.

4. **Memory Management**: The implementation carefully manages memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring no memory leaks.

5. **Fixed-size Arrays as Queue**: Using fixed-size arrays with front and rear pointers is a simple and efficient queue implementation in C.

## Common Pitfalls and Edge Cases

1. **Empty Tree**: Handled by checking if the root is NULL.

2. **Memory Allocation Failures**: In a production environment, you should check if malloc calls succeed.

3. **Queue Overflow**: The fixed-size queue could overflow for extremely large trees.

4. **Single Node Tree**: Works correctly, returning a single level with one node.

5. **Unbalanced Trees**: The algorithm handles unbalanced trees correctly, as BFS doesn't depend on tree balance.

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Two-pass Approach**: Another approach would be to perform a regular level order traversal, store all levels, and then return them in reverse order.

2. **DFS with Level Tracking**: Using DFS with level tracking and a map/dictionary to group nodes by level could also work, though BFS is more natural for this problem.

3. **Using Standard Library**: If using C++, standard containers like queue and vector would simplify the implementation.

## Conclusion

The `levelOrderBottom` function effectively performs a bottom-up level order traversal of a binary tree using BFS. It handles memory management according to the problem requirements and works correctly for all valid binary tree inputs.

This implementation demonstrates important concepts in tree traversal, queue-based algorithms, and memory management in C, making it a valuable educational example for understanding both binary trees and C programming techniques.
