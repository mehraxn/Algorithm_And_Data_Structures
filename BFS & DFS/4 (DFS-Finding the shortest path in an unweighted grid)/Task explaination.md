# Finding the Shortest Path in an Unweighted Grid - README

## **Problem Statement**
You are given a 2D grid (matrix) where each cell represents a position on a map. Your task is to find the shortest path from a given **starting point** `(sr, sc)` to a **destination point** `(dr, dc)`. The grid consists of passable (`1`) and impassable (`0`) cells. You can only move **up, down, left, or right** (not diagonally).

Return the **minimum number of steps** required to reach the destination. If there is no valid path, return `-1`.

## **Example**

### **Input Grid**
```
1 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1 1
```

#### **Starting Position:** `(0, 0)`, **Destination Position:** `(3, 4)`

### **Output**
```
7
```

### **Explanation**
The shortest path is as follows:
```
(S) â†’ (0,1) â†’ (1,1) â†’ (2,1) â†’ (2,2) â†’ (2,3) â†’ (3,3) â†’ (D)
```
Total **7** steps.

## **Understanding the Problem Deeply**

### **What is the Shortest Path?**
- The path with the **minimum number of moves** from `(sr, sc)` to `(dr, dc)`.
- Moves are allowed **only in four directions** (up, down, left, right).

### **What is NOT a Valid Path?**
- Moving **diagonally** is NOT allowed.
- Stepping on `0` (an impassable cell) is NOT allowed.
- Going **out of bounds** of the grid is NOT allowed.

### **Input Constraints**
- The grid is an `m x n` matrix (`1 â‰¤ m, n â‰¤ 1000`).
- `0 â‰¤ sr, dr < m`, `0 â‰¤ sc, dc < n` (valid indices in the grid).
- `grid[sr][sc] == 1` and `grid[dr][dc] == 1` (both start and destination must be passable).
- The grid consists of `1`s (passable) and `0`s (impassable).

### **Output Format**
- An integer representing the shortest number of steps.
- Return `-1` if no path exists.

## **Approach to Solve the Problem**
We use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** because:
1. **BFS explores level by level**, ensuring the first time we reach the destination is via the shortest path.
2. **DFS is not suitable** as it explores deep before checking all possible short paths.
3. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is not needed** since all moves have equal weight (1 step per move).

### **Steps to Solve Using BFS:**
1. **Initialize a queue** and start from `(sr, sc)` with `0` steps.
2. **Use a visited set** to prevent revisiting cells.
3. **Iterate through all possible movements (up, down, left, right).**
4. **Stop when we reach `(dr, dc)`.**
5. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, return `-1` (no valid path).

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- Each cell is processed once â†’ **O(m Ã— n)**
- Each cell has at most 4 neighbors â†’ **O(4 Ã— m Ã— n) â‰ˆ O(m Ã— n)**
- Space Complexity â†’ **O(m Ã— n)** (for queue & visited set)

## **Common Mistakes & Edge Cases**

### **1. No Path Exists**
- If the destination is surrounded by `0`s, return `-1`.
- If the starting position itself is blocked (`0`), return `-1` immediately.

### **2. Revisiting Cells**
- If we donâ€™t mark visited cells, BFS may reprocess them, leading to infinite loops.
- Always **mark cells as visited when enqueuing them, NOT when dequeuing**.

### **3. Edge Cases**
- **Start and End at the Same Position:**
  - If `(sr, sc) == (dr, dc)`, return `0`.
- **All `1`s:**
  - The entire grid is `1`, so the shortest path is straightforward.
- **Grid Edges:**
  - Ensure you donâ€™t access out-of-bounds indices.

## **Final Thought**
Finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid is a fundamental problem in computer science. **BFS guarantees an optimal solution** because it explores all shortest paths first. Understanding this will help in solving **mazes, AI pathfinding, and robot navigation** problems.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
