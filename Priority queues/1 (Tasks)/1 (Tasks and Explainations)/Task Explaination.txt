You are given an array score of size n, where each element in the array represents the score of
an athlete in a competition. The goal is to assign ranks to these athletes based on their scores.
The ranks are assigned as follows:

The athlete with the highest score gets the rank "Gold Medal".
The athlete with the second-highest score gets the rank "Silver Medal".
The athlete with the third-highest score gets the rank "Bronze Medal".

From the 4th place onward, athletes are ranked based on their position in the sorted list of scores,
starting from "4" for the 4th highest score, "5" for the 5th highest, and so on.Finally, you must 
return an array where the rank of each athlete corresponds to their position in the original input
array score.

Input
You are provided with:

An integer array score of size n.
Each element represents the score of an athlete.
Scores are guaranteed to be unique.
Output
You need to return:

An array of strings where each string represents the rank of the athlete at the corresponding position in the input array.
Examples
Example 1
Input: score = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Process:
Sort the scores in descending order: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Assign ranks:
1st place (highest score 5): "Gold Medal"
2nd place (second-highest score 4): "Silver Medal"
3rd place (third-highest score 3): "Bronze Medal"
4th place (score 2): "4"
5th place (score 1): "5"
Match the ranks back to the original indices.
Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
Example 2
Input: score = [10, 3, 8, 9, 4]
Process:
Sort the scores in descending order: [10, 9, 8, 4, 3]
Assign ranks:
1st place (highest score 10): "Gold Medal"
2nd place (second-highest score 9): "Silver Medal"
3rd place (third-highest score 8): "Bronze Medal"
4th place (score 4): "4"
5th place (score 3): "5"
Match the ranks back to the original indices.
Output: ["Gold Medal", "5", "Bronze Medal", "Silver Medal", "4"]
Constraints
n == score.length
The number of athletes equals the size of the array.
1 <= n <= 10^4
The array can have up to 10,000 elements.
0 <= score[i] <= 10^6
Scores are non-negative integers, and each score is guaranteed to be unique.
